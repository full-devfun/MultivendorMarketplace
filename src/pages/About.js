        <h1>Vision</h1>
        <p>Local Guru connects people looking for good food with the farmers who cultivate it. We believe that food should be consumed where it is grown. This creates a transparent and honest food system that is better for everyone. The global potential to grow food within city limits is massive.</p>
        <p>Purchasing food from people you trust and developing strong local economies is what buying locally is all about. The mission of the local food movement is to create thriving community-based food systems that make high quality food accessible to everyone.</p>

        We deliver directly to the consumer. We meet this challenge with a vision: create a better food system through local agriculture in all facets. This means partnering up with local farmers and food makers.

        We require all of our producers to allow community visits on a monthly basis. This allows our Producers and Consumers to establish a relationship of trust.  During this community outreach, consumers may test the food in order to develop trust.

      <p>We believe in a culture of community. We want to make sure that local producers have a place to sell food to their neighbors. Your neighbors have something different and inventive to offer you to enjoy that will sustain their family and yours.</p>
      <p>Options are important. This is why we believe in the Small Farms who have been overrun for far too long by the Large Farm.</p>

        Reinventing a broken food system without the community is unthinkable. We are constantly curious for your feedback on our process and how we can make things more efficient for you.
